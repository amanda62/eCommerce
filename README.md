# eCommerce Site

This is the start of the UI for an eCommerce site, as a project for Professor Hamachi's CIS193 course.

## Questions

#### What were some of the struggles and accomplishments that you experienced during this project?

I couldn't make it go live from my Github page. I may have to swap out react-router-dom's <BrowserRouter /> for <HashRouter /> and use window.location.hash instead of history.
I still have a long way to go getting comfortable with CSS Grid and Flexbox.

#### Are you planning to continue building on your project after this class? If so, how?

With more time, I would like to build out the mobile layout, create views for the client to add their products, implement a better search, add a form to the cart and handle billing, make a database to manage stock... and so much more. Most of all, I'd like to start from scratch and write everything cleaner, making more of the application reusable (especially styles!).

#### What did you learn from this experience?

As always, it becomes abundantly clear how difficult it is to switch between the modes of designing/critiquing a page, and coding it.

#### What advice would you give to future students in the CIS program at PCC?

Don’t enroll in other classes. Give yourself enough time to treat the class as a starting point and go beyond what is required to actually learn the material. Ultimately, what you learn is up to you.

#### How do you intend to use what you have learned so far?

I would like to further build out my projects, and my Github page to have a good portfolio.

#### How can you use your skills to give back to your community?

I’ve started a small collection of blog posts, and would like to add a section to my Github page to show them. I’d like to have more cheatsheet-style pages, both for myself, and to offer to anyone else who needs them.

#### How can your project help you in the future?

An eCommerce website is a good addition to a portfolio to show to potential employers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
